just a notes file to write down the thought process
I have a slice in golang which can be used to write data into json and also to extract data from json
So my question was 
if I modify the slice in anyway 
and then read the data back into the json file
will all the previously written data be overwritten?
I looked it up and apparantly yes the data will be overwritten
current structure is wrong it pops out the data as soon as the reminder time is met
It will have to be changed once the interface is up and running
The user should be asked wether or not they would like to keep the task or not 
If they say yes then the task should stay as it is
If not then the task should be updated
