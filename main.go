	grandIO()

}

//I could use a loop but that would mean that I ask the user on how many reminders he is going to add which is not a good idea
//I could use a grand if else block
//the entire code would be inside a giant function on the other page
//there would be a grand scanner which stores the value of the very first yes then at the very end of the function with the grand scanner
//the function will call itself recursively
//if the user types in yes then the same loop would continue but if the user replies with no then the loop will terminate
//20 Feb Code sprint-
//Write the operations inside the granIO function in supporter.go
